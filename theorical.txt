Javascript class
Classes are introduced in ES6 which looks similar to classes in other object oriented languages, such as Java,
PHP, etc., however they do not work exactly the same way. ES6 classes make it easier to create objects, 
implement inheritance by using the extends keyword, and reuse the code.

In JavaScript, classes are the special type of functions. We can define the class just like function 
declarations and function expressions.
The JavaScript class contains various class members within a body including methods or constructor. The 
class is executed in strict mode. So, the code containing the silent error or mistake throws an error.
The class syntax contains two components:

Class declarations
Class expressions

Class Declarations
A class can be defined by using a class declaration. A class keyword is used to declare a class with any 
particular name. According to JavaScript naming conventions, the name of the class always starts with an 
uppercase letter.
